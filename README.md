# OmniHub / HomeHub

This repository contains scaffolding for the HomeHub project: a self-hosted household hub (backend server, web UI, and Flutter app).

This initial commit includes a minimal Flask server with a shared groceries API and Socket.IO realtime events.

Next steps

- Build the web frontend (React) in `/web`
- Create the Flutter app in `/flutter`
- Add auth and user management
- Integrate with Home Assistant or devices
