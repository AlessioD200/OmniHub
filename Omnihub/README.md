# HomeHub Flutter app

This is a minimal Flutter scaffold that demonstrates fetching the groceries list from the server and posting new items.

Notes:
- When running an Android emulator, use `10.0.2.2` to reach the host machine's localhost.
- To enable realtime updates, add `socket_io_client` usage and subscribe to the same events as the web client.
